      <h2>Welcome to the Kira College Web Page</h2>
      <img class=center src="Media/kc_server_farm.jpg" alt="kc_server_farm.jpg"></img>
      <p>Kira College is a revolutionary new University system where everying is digitised for the greater benefit. All interactions occur on a deep level and distractions are heavily limited. This is thanks to the use of Virtual Reality (VR) headsets that are in use by students and staff. VR allows the school to take up no more than a few small warehouses of space which hosts our heavily redundant and secure server farms.</p>
      <p>Our new University system opens up a new sector of learning; one that could not be opened without the correct mixture of technological advancement, high risk and ambition. This is only the beginning, or what some may call it <i>"only the tip of the ice-berg"</i>.</p>
